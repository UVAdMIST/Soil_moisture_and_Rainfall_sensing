# UVAHydroInformatics
Soil moisture probes, tipping buckets, and radio transmitters

# For transmitting data, NRF24L01 Transmitters were used and calls were made which required importing a library into the Arduino IDE.
# For posting data on a server, calls were made using the Blynk Library (made by a team at MIT) which requires importing their library as well.
